# Reproducible Research - Course Project 1

## Introduction

The dataset for this project was created by the source data set in the data folder in this repository. The original file is an archive - activity.zip. The archive contains the file activity.csv from which the data is imported. The data was provided from the Coursera course website. 

## About the source data

The dataset contains data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day. The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.
